# JS-Scraper

There has been many cases that proved teenagers have less tendency to read
newspaper articles. As a fellow teenager myself, I have put an effort to combat this issue
by simplifying the process of reading the news easier and more convenient by
providing a technique that extracts news summary and and classifying them
based on the level of how positive or negative they are. Hoping that this will
be of more fun and engaging way to improve the rate of teenage awareness in
current affairs.

The project is done with Node.js along with the Puppeteer library and more.
